# Megan's Notes

- Broaden website/social medial committee
  - Dan issued a call for committee members, which did generate some interest for this committee.
    - ACTION ITEM: Dan will assign members to committees in the near future and be in touch with a new committee list

- Need to update photos
  - ACTION ITEM: Website committee will draft language for cell for photos and will provide to Megan to send to NSCI faculty and NSCI student distribution list
  - Should ask for photos & videos that show
    - Research
    - Events
    - Outreach
    - Faculty
    - Students
    - Diversity
  - Give deadline
  - Include to whom is collecting photos
  - Once photos are received, collect into a OneDrive and share to Megan – Megan will place with NSCI program photos we’ve collected over the years
  - ACTION ITEM: Megan will request neuro photos from OGPS & INI

- Update dead links
  - James has run a report which finds some, will run again after the initial ones are addressed

- Megan will email G.C. giving heads up about frequent changes and ask for permission levels to be updated for James & Lex. Megan will check if we can clone an existing page, and then use that clone as a draft version. Once ready for this draft to go live, it can replace currently live page.

- James & Lex will draft changes before we make any live changes.  Proposed updates will be run through Dan, Mike & Megan prior to them going “live”.

- “Brain Awareness” on menu ribbon > Update to outreach.  Lex/James/committee assigned here
  - Include info on our outreach
    - Neuroscience Research Day
    - Brain Bee
  - Include links to outreach we participate in
    - Girls Go Stem
    - MidBrains
    - Other outreach with CCOM/STEM

- “Undergraduate” on menu ribbon  (this is a change Megan can make quickly/easily and soon)
  - Have an undergraduate page that links to
  - https://clas.uiowa.edu/neuro
  - https://www.grad.uiowa.edu/biomedical-scholars-summer-undergraduate-research-program

- Main banner on homepage – what are the specs/photo dimensions?  Lex/James – please ask John/Matt this

- Remove background on main links for menu item pages (about, students, faculty, etc) so that it is plain white and looks cleaner. Lex/James – John/Matt will need to help with this

- Seminar on menu ribbon
  - Locations
    - Remove Van Allen
    - List others in this order
      - PBDB (Default location)
      - BBE (4th Tuesdays)
      - MERF (Guest speakers)

- Training Grant needs to be woven into more of the language across multiple pages (Lex/James – once you have access to pages you should be able to make this change yourself)
  - Include on
    - About
    - Program History
    - Financial Assistance

- Thesis Defenses not displayed onto “Current Students” page. Megan added, but formatting is funny – emailed John & Matt about this

- Curriculum page will need to be addressed
  - Should be compared to current handbook (linked on website), can this be reviewed/edited by Website Committee?

- Twitter
  - Currently is mirror posting to Facebook. Lex done password reset to gain access herself, without luck. Lex & James will continue to work on gaining access so they can control content on Twitter easier/quicker.

# Feedback on Website

- Dead Links
- Brain Awareness Week -> Brain Outreach (the many outreach programs)
- Full Description of neuroscience research day
- more images (get a photographer) dimensions (call for images).
    - INI requested photos
    - Feature people in the photos
    - submit photos via students
- Undergraduate should link to a page that goes to the undergrad major or the summer program
- photos for the background (genetics doesn't have a background, maybe copy their design)
- we only have access to grad college websites
- reference to the training grant
    - Kept the program at the cutting edge.
- Onedrive photos (getting people)

## Vignettes for website

- Muhammad is in his senior of college (major: psychology) at a college on the west coast,
  and he is actively searching and applying for grad schools.
  He is applying for schools across the country and is looking for a lab that studies child brain development since he's doing his senior project on that topic.
  He has grown up in urban/highly populated areas and generally considers the midwest flyover country,
  nonetheless he applies to several schools in the midwest to be conprehensive.

- Sandra (from another country)

- Kyla from iowa looking for place in midwest, doesn't want to move far and wonders what's there for her, how can visit the campus, who would guide her?

- current student

- faculty

- potential faculty looking for jobs
